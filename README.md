# 455_morphing

Image Morphing is a final project for IAT 455: Computational Media. Using the OpenCV library, we took somewhat similar images and use feature detection to locate key morphing points. Then using Delaunay Triangulation, we established spatial relationships between each key pixel. Unfortunately, the final morphing behaviour was not achieved as we ran into problems with our Range of Interest dimension and bit channels; and could not complete this whole process within the alloted time.
The GUI is functional and allows a user to select images that the application would then morph to from image-to-image.
